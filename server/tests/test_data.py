Coffee enthusiasts, you’ll find yourselves spoilt for choice with robust cups of Joe, while brunch goers can indulge in aesthetic cafes serving inventive dishes in a plethora of different ways — eggs Benny move aside, cos cafes nowadays are offering more than just that. 
Using our foodie senses, we’ve rounded up a list of 36 spots we love — for brunch, a quick coffee, or even for a leisurely afternoon of people watching. Save this ‘cos this list will be all you need. 
61 Neil Road
Open: Monday to Sunday (8.30am to 5.30pm)
2 Owen Road
Open: Monday to Thursday (8.30am to 5.30pm), Friday to Sunday (8.30am to 10pm)
Why visit? Designed to give you the perfect audio experience, Acoustics Coffee Bar has incorporated acoustic panels on its walls to minimise echo and improve the overall sound system in its cafe. With this little touch, you can enjoy quality conversations, chill music or just give your senses a break from the bustling sound of the city. 
No cafe is complete without a top notch menu so trust that your sense of taste is in for a treat, too. The cafe serves an expansive all-day brunch menu along with mains that include meats, pastas, salads and more. 
Crowd favourites: If you go hungry, the Acoustics breakfast (S$24) is a big breakfast that serves sourdough, chipotle sausage, maple glazed bacon, mushrooms, scrambled egg and a salad. Balanced, hearty and absolutely satisfying. 
If you’re looking for a snack to share, the truffle tots (S$15) is an easy crowd pleaser. These addictive tater tots, tossed in premium truffle oil, salt, pepper and grated grana padano (cheese) are great for sharing, but we won’t blame you if you want a serving all to yourself. 
Icon Village, 01-05, 12 Gopeng Street
Open: Monday to Saturday (8am to 9.30pm) Sunday (8am to 6pm)
Why visit? With so many cafes in Singapore, Alice Boulangerie makes the list just based on its croissants alone. Founded by a mother-daughter duo with a penchant for all things sweet and baked, this Tanjong Pagar cafe is where you’ll find delicate French pastries carefully curated to the local palate. 
If pastries are your jam (pun intended), stop by for big, fresh, flaky pastries made with a touch of innovation and generous dollop of French butter. From flat croissants (yes, flat!) to its famous gula Melaka cinnamon roll, we’re sure you’ll find a pastry that’ll hit the spot. Alice Boulangerie also serves up a mean brunch menu with classic brunch staples and a little bit more. 
Crowd favourites: Some mornings you just want a sinfully delightful sugary pastry and for that, the gula melaka cinnamon roll (S$8) is an easy choice. But if you’re team savoury, we loved the bacon truffle potato pain suisse (S$8) while avocado toast lovers rated the burrata pesto avocado toast (S$22) as their number one choice.
27 Scotts Road
Open: Tuesday to Friday (11.30am to 6pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 6pm)
Why visit? Ami Patisserie is where the food of the west meets the ingredients of the east. Beautiful European-style pastries are delicately crafted with Japanese influences to create the perfect tea time experience. The best part? You get to enjoy all of it within a rustic, Kyoto-style teahouse. 
Choose from an array of sweet and savoury treats, crafted by head patissier Makoto Arami, and wash it down with your choice of premium coffee, tea or the iced Valrhona chocolate. 
Crowd favourites: For anyone who loves a good burrata, the burrata cheese and parma ham croissant (S$14) is a good choice while those who are team sweet over savoury can pick up the  almond pain perdu (S$18.50).
Read about our visit to Ami Patisserie. 
37A Neil Road, Second Floor
Open: Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday (1pm to 5.30pm), Friday to Saturday (12.30pm to 6.30pm)
Why visit? Arc En Ciel (pronounced as “ar-kon-see-ell”) is a Paris-inspired dessert parlour, born from the love of eating delicate sweet treats in the park on warm Parisian days. The interior of the space is reflective of just that with its lush plants and pebble stone floors. 
During the day, the menu offers mousse cakes and tea mocktails while the night concept serves plated desserts and tea cocktails (alcoholic). 
Crowd favourites: During the day, get the Elijah (S$11.50), a lovely tangy white chocolate lime mousse, inspired by the nostalgic flavours of the quintessential Singaporean childhood classic, the Solero ice-cream. 
Come sunset, try the Antoine (S$15) which is a lovely blend of white wine infused pears, caramel, almonds and sweetened with honey. 
Learn more about Lin Jiawen, the owner of Arc En Ciel. 
6 Duke’s Road 
Open: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 7pm)
Why visit? Atlas Coffeehouse sees a regular crowd made up of a mix of brunch goers, nearby residents and the local cycling community. It’s a weekend hotspot well-loved for its large hearty brunch menu and quality brews. Despite its relatively fancy setting, it is one of the more affordable cafes in Singapore with mains ranging from S$16 to S$25. 
With so many things going for it, it’s not uncommon to have to queue for about 10 to 15 minutes for a spot here, especially on the weekends. 
Crowd favourites: Slow mornings are best with the Gentleman’s Relish (S$16.80), with soft scrambled eggs, vine tomatoes, tomato chutney, compound butter, honey mascarpone, and sourdough. You’ll also notice that everyone’s getting the wurst rosti (S$23), a potato rosti with bacon fennel pan sauce, cheese frank, sunny side up eggs and tomato chutney — you should, too!
Ngee Ann City, B1-16 to 24, 391 Orchard Road 
Open: Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 8pm)
Why visit? If minimalistic chic is your aesthetic, Cafe Found is one of the best cafes in Singapore for you. It’s nestled within the Editor’s Market, the fashion centre of Orchard and makes for the perfect spot to rest your tired feet while sipping on an iced coffee. 
We especially love the cafe for its half and half toast, where customers can have one piece of toast, cut into two, topped with two two different toppings — the classic scrambled eggs and cheese, and the honey mascarpone and Japanese strawberries are our top choices. 
Crowd favourites: Get two flavours on one slice with the half and half toast (S$16), then finish it off with its unique gelato croffles (S$18) or the delectable lavender basque cheesecake (S$7.50) — whichever dessert you choose, you can’t go wrong!
Here’s our list of more cafes in Takashimaya to explore. 
Royal Square Novena, 02-10, 103 Irrawaddy Road
Open: Tuesday to Saturday (9am to 6pm)
278 South Bridge Road
Open: Monday to Tuesday (10.30am to 6.30pm), Thursday to Saturday (10.30am to 9.30pm), Sunday (10.30am to 4.30pm)
Why visit? Cafe Gui brings Korean-Japanese cuisine into a space dominated by western fare, making it stand out in the cafe scene. 
Even though it has two outlets, they’re both strikingly different. The one in Novena has an all-white chic concept that is modern and minimalistic while the outlet in South Bridge has a more rustic vibe with dark wood features and traditional Korean decor — pick your outlet depending on your cafe-hopping vibe of the day. 
Crowd favourites: The dosirak rice box (S$15.90), at its South Bridge outlet, is Cafe Gui’s bestseller. It consists of premium luncheon meat, a sunny egg, kimchi with pork, and seaweed rice. For the uninitiated: A dosirak is a container of rice, meat and veggies that is shaken to mix then enjoyed as all the components have been evenly mixed. 
For a touch of sweetness, the Japanese Hojicha pudding (S$7.90) made with an in-house Hojicha syrup is a definite bestseller. 
1a Duxton Hill, 01-01
Open: Tuesday – Sunday (10am to 6pm)
Why visit? Designed for coffee aficionados with a penchant for that raw, unfinished aesthetic, Cloud serves up feel-good coffee and pastries in an industrial-like setting. For anyone who is easily overstimulated by the city, Cloud is a great space of respite. 
In the mornings, you can find patrons sipping a cup of joe or grabbing one to-go. Get your very own Cloud experience when you swing by to people watch and clear your head, with caffeine in one hand and a sea salt chocolate cookie in the other. 
Crowd favourites: There’s minimal thinking here with its straightforward menu so get a cup of coffee (from S$3), any of Cloud’s cookies (from S$2) and a slice of banana cake (S$5) — you’ll be in for a lovely treat. 
220 Upper Thomson Road 
Open: Tuesday to Saturday (9am to 10pm), Sunday (9am to 7pm)
Why visit? There are many cafes along the Upper Thomson stretch, but Columbus Coffee Co stands out with its calm, earthy tones with bright lighting — we easily can see why it’s a popular spot for families and co-working groups. While it serves up a delightful brunch menu (9am to 3pm), diners can also enjoy hearty mains that include burgers, pastas, and donburi during this time and after brunch hours. 
It’s also worth mentioning that coffee is serious business here, so pair your meal with your coffee of choice. Choose from a nice variety of coffee styles or opt for the drip coffee with a selection of beans ranging in caffeine strength and flavour profiles. 
Crowd favourites: When rice is life, opt for mentaiko salmon donburi (S$20.50) for a nice balanced meal of japanese rice served with aburi mentaiko salmon, crispy egg, ikura, chives and nori. 
If quintessential cafe fare is your jam, the hotcakes & passionfruit (S$15) is an easy choice for a stack of diner-style pancakes served with passionfruit curd, blueberries and a drizzle of maple syrup. 
Multiple stores available islandwide. 
Open: Operating hours vary across stores
Why visit? Common Man Coffee Roasters roast, sell and serve high-quality grade Arabica coffee, ensuring every cup is brewed to perfection. Having mastered the art of coffee, its beans are sold wholesale and the brand is easily recognised across Singapore and Malaysia. When it comes to the menu, the perfection you see in coffee continues to their food. 
During the day, you will find a stunning brunch menu and once the sun sets, the kitchen switches gears to offer a casually elegant affair along with a wine list that’s not to be missed. 
Crowd favourites: For breakfast, the ox cheek eggs benedict (S$28) is a nice twist to a classic brunch staple. Beautifully poached eggs with a hollandaise sauce, topped with tender braised ox cheeks, this dish is perfect for a luxurious slow morning. 
From the night menu, the duck & foie gras pie (S$38) is lovely for sharing. It features a medley of flavours that come so beautifully together as it combines duck, foie gras, black truffle, burnt apple puree, orange miso sauce and finished with an arugula and fennel salad. 
Sun Court, Lorong Kilat, 01-07 
Open: Monday to Thursday (10am to 8pm), Friday and Saturday (8am to 10pm), Sunday (8am to 8pm)
Why visit? For anyone who takes their coffee seriously, Cowpresso Coffee Roasters is where you’re meant to be. It doesn’t just serve up coffee but offers the full works with a retail corner selling machines, coffee beans, capsules, and everything you’d need to make your own cuppa. 
Along with a comprehensive selection of beverages, you’ll find freshly baked pastries, toasts and a small menu of bites and mains. It’s the perfect spot for a quick bite or to grab a coffee to go. 
Crowd favourites: Satisfy your morning caffeine fix with the nitro brew on tap (from S$10) or for the non-coffee drinkers, the Ghana cocoa chocolate (from S$6.20) is just as lovely. Pair your beverage with its soft and fluffy housemade brioche doughnuts (from S$4.90). 
Crown Centre,  557 Bukit Timah Road, 01-03
Open: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 9pm)
Why visit? Founded on the belief that bread can be healthy and delicious sans the need of harmful additives, preservatives, and other nasties, Crown Bakery & Cafe is well-loved for its fresh, wholesome bread and delectable brunch dishes. The cafe is helmed by a Japanese master baker Katsuei Shiga who has brought over Japanese techniques and methods, guaranteed to give you satisfaction in every bite. 
On the menu you will find everything you could want from a cafe, from brunch staples, and mains to pastas, and insta-worthy desserts. While there, you’re also likely to see nearby residents swing by for a loaf of ciabatta, some bagels or even a box of beautiful pastries and warm cookies, it’s truly a neighbourhood gem! 
Crowd favourites: Dine like royalty with an order of the queen’s eggs Ben (S$17.45). Similar to eggs benedict, you will enjoy a lovely sourdough English muffin, poached eggs, shaved honey baked ham served with a luxuriously creamy hollandaise and a side salad. 
To sample a variety of baked goodness, the pastry & cookie box (S$22.90) offers four different cookies, two mini croissants and two mini pain au chocolat. We know the bakes can be uber tempting, but we think this makes for a lovely gift, too!
102 Tanjong Pagar Road 
Open: Monday to Sunday (1pm to 10.30pm)
Why visit? You know that feeling when your desserts are so pretty, that you must take pictures first and then very slowly cut into them? Delicatesse specialises in crafting delicate French desserts that give you that exact emotion as you look at its offerings. 
Located at Tanjong Pagar, this quaint spot serves up a small but good-looking selection of beautiful pastries, cakes and tarts — it’s the place to be for a unique yet indulgent sweet treat.
Crowd favourites: The strawberry Saint Honore (S$10) is an easy favourite that’s chewy, fresh and not overly sweet. In place of the usual puff pastry are strawberry macarons, a nice little touch that makes this a one-of-a-kind find in Singapore. 
The Asian-inspired dessert lovers will love the matcha Mont Blanc (S$10) a common French chestnut puree treat, with rich matcha in its place, complimenting the almond base perfectly.
82 Tiong Poh Road, 01-05
Open: Monday to Friday (10am to 10pm), Saturday to Sunday (9am to 10pm)
Why visit? Drips Bakery Cafe at Holland Village serves up an all-day breakfast menu with all the usual breakfast suspects from avocado toast to even the very local nasi lemak. Aside from being a great breakfast spot, it is also known for its speciality in tarts and buttery pastries, made with 100% pure butter. 
It offers a nice variety of tarts with the fresh fruit tart being the most popular, especially when you’re looking for something sweet for those days when you’re just craving dessert. 
Crowd favourites: It was hard to pick a favourite but our top three, which are also major crowd pleasers, are the seasonal fresh fruit tart (S$15.30), fresh yuzu tart (S$12) and pistachio mascarpone (S$14.20).
803 King George’s Avenue, 02-216
Open: Monday to Friday (10am to 6pm), Saturday to Sunday (10am to 4pm)
7 Tanjong Pagar Plaza, 01-102
Open: Monday to Wednesday (10am to 6pm), Thursday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)
Why visit? If quaint, feels-like-home type cafes are what you look for, Elijah Pies at Tanjong Pagar is your spot — this is the brand’s first dine-in space after operating as a takeaway-only kiosk for a while. It’s warm, quirky and so comfy that we think it’ll be hard to get up and leave after polishing a few slices of pie. There, you can find a selection of sweet and savoury pies, each made with familiar flavours that are combined and elevated to be uniquely exclusive. 
The innovation doesn’t stop at its pies, though. Elijah Pies also has a fun little drinks menu studded with choices such as strawberry matcha and a vanilla pistachio drink. 
Crowd favourites: The Nutella pie (S$7.50) is easily a crowd favourite for being just that, a Nutella pie — who doesn’t love Nutella, am I right? Sinfully indulgent, nostalgic and perfect for a rainy day. For something more elevated, the wild berry lavender pie (S$7.90) is light and refreshing, with fresh berries and hints of lavender swirled into a generous yogurt topping. 
106 Jalan Jurong Kechil 
Open: Monday (10am to 9pm), Wednesday to Friday (10am to 11.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 11pm)
Why visit? Have you ever wanted to sit in a cafe in Singapore for dinner? If you’re craving eggs, mushrooms, bacon, and bread at 8pm, then you get eggs, mushrooms, bacon, and bread at 8pm! 
Flag White offers an all-day DIY brunch menu along with other savoury items including burgers, lasagna, and pork ribs too. Pair it with a coffee or bottled kombucha to complete your meal and you’re likely to leave satisfied. 
Crowd favourite: Keep it easy, classic, and tailored to your preferred taste with the mix & match brunch (starts with eggs at $2) or hit the fixed menu for the quinoa kale burger stack (S$15). You’ll get a crumbed quinoa kale patty with a sunny side up egg, capsicum, crispy onion shavings, cheddar and a delicious thai chilli aioli.
78 Moh Guan Terrace, 01-25 
Open: Monday to Sunday (8am to 8.30pm)
Why visit? If you love a good coffee, Flock Cafe is easily one of the best cafes in Singapore to grab some. It gets rave reviews for its coffee, wide breakfast menu, and its housemade burgers.
If you’re a brunch-goer, you’re likely to find a bit of a crowd on the weekends with a steady stream of patrons. To ensure you enjoy a space to get a bit of work done, come by on weekdays for good food and stable Wi-Fi. 
Crowd favourites: Come hungry and fill up on the housemade burger (S$18) made with a beef patty, crispy bacon, and all the trimmings. 
If burgers are not your vibe, the Club pancakes (S$17.80) is a savoury pancake complete with cheese, ham, sausage, eggs and a side salad, perfect for breakfast, lunch and brunch!
SBF Center, 01-01, 160 Robinson Road  
Open: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 5.30pm)
Why visit? When you’ve got a hankering for a Melbourne-style brunch, Good Egg by Bearded Bella should come to mind. Unpretentious, quirky and one of the many pretty cafes in Singapore, this small cafe serves up a mean French toast, good eggs, and legit coffee. All of its dishes come with a little unique touch, such as a rosti taco or even a doughnut burger.
If you run on caffeine, it does coffee really well and the cafe even has a coffee subscription you can sign up for, so you can enjoy your favourite brew at home! 
Crowd favourite: Start with a coffee of your choice, available from S$4.50 and tuck into a classic brunch. The sliced avocado toast (S$17) is the Melbourne staple but since it’s hot and humid, the Cooler than A/C (S$14) would probably be a wiser choice — it’s a vegan chia pudding with an acai berry base topped with banana, dark chocolate, granola, hazelnut sea salt butter, and fruity pebbles. 
1 Tessensohn Road, 01-10
Open: Monday to Friday (8am to 5pm) Saturday to Sunday (8am to 6pm)
Why visit? Just as its name suggests, Hey Slow Joe is where you go to slow down with a cuppa joe. It’s easily one of the best cafes in Singapore simply because you’re reminded to take a break from the bustling city and slow down in a cosy little space. 
Pop-in for your caffeine fix and a sweet treat, either to unwind and dine-in or for a quick grab-and-go as you start your day. The space is small, though, so be prepared to squeeze or stand around. Either way, the friendly owners are sure to make you feel at ease, regardless. 
Crowd favourites: An easy favourite is the cuppa joe (S$8), an iced cappuccino made with cold foam, giving you that cool creamy finish. Pair it with one of its cakes or tarts and you’re good to go. 
For something sweet and nutty, the pecan tart (S$8) is served warm and goes perfectly with an iced coffee. 
Read about the three founders of this quiet cafe. 
Guoco Tower, 01-20, 5 Wallich Street
Open: Monday to Thursday (11am to 9pm), Friday to Saturday (11am to 9.30pm), Sunday (11am to 8pm)
Why visit? If you want to fly off to Japan but your bank balance doesn’t allow for it, head to Japan Rail Cafe instead. It’s a unique cafe in Singapore that pays homage to Japanese food, culture and well, train stations! The interior is decked out in soft brown tones, replicating that calm and serene feel you’re likely to experience when in Japan. 
On the menu you will find a small variety of rice based dishes, refreshing drinks and Japanese sake, guaranteed to transport you away from the busy city of Singapore.
Crowd favourites: If matcha lattes are your love language, the Kyoto uji matcha latte (S$6) is a definite must-try. Pair it with the bestselling watashino curry rice (S$17) and you’re set for a rainy afternoon. 
Citilink Warehouse Complex, 01-08, 102E, Pasir Panjang Road
Open: Monday, Wednesday to Friday (10.30am to 9pm), Saturday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)
160 Paya Lebar Rd, #01-07
Open: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)
Why visit? Knots Cafe & Living is a unique cafe in Singapore that combines the love for food, flowers, and furniture. You can dine-in and shop for beautiful handpicked decor pieces and flowers, all under one roof. Step in and you will find yourself surrounded by lush living art pieces in the form of moss walls, flower bouquets and unique trinkets with the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting in the air. 
Its wide menu ensures there’s something for everyone whether you’re in the mood for pizza, pastas or brunch. As a grazer, I personally loved that the bites menu was well curated to include things such as truffle fries, camembert cheese platters and a charcuterie board. 
Crowd favourites: Come hungry and tuck in when you order the Knots waffles brekkie (S$26.40). It requires a 15 minute waiting time so you know you’re getting fresh-off-the-grill buttermilk waffles with smoked beef sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs and some veggies. 
The drink menu is just as impressive with an artisanal tea (S$7.50) menu that offers 7 flavours to choose from. 
336 Tanjong Katong Road
Open: Monday to Sunday (8.30am to 6pm)
Why visit? Little Rogue Coffee was given its moniker by the owners who were inspired by the cheekiness of their children. Keeping in theme, the cafe has a lovely homely feel with soft lighting, plants in every corner, and a kids play area. 
It doesn’t just pass the vibe check, the food is great, too — everything on the menu has a special twist on it, even the most ordinary croissant is served with kombu butter, making it extra special. 
Crowd favourites: Kick off the morning with the soft scrambled eggs with ikura (S$18) or go meaty with the galbi-jjim (S$20), or Korean braised beef. For this item, the beef is used as a sandwich filling, and it also comes with kimchi, cheddar cheese and a sunny egg on sourdough bread. 
57 East Coast Road
Open: Monday and Tuesday (8am to 5pm) Wednesday to Sunday (8am 10.30pm)
Why visit? More than just a brunch spot, Monk’s Brew Cafe in Joo Chiat is one of the many cool cafes in Singapore, thanks to its multi-purpose event space and deliciously wide menu.
You can pop-by for brunch or dinner, to get some work done, or have a couple of cocktails at night. With so much to do, we can see why it’s such a hotspot throughout the day. 
Crowd favourites: Tuck into a full spread with the breakfast hot plate (S$24). It comes with all your must-haves: Chicken sausages, tomatoes, crispy bacon, potato tots and veggies, served with bread and your choice of eggs. 
For a tipple that packs a punch, try the Death By Morning (S$20), the in-house take on the classic espresso martini. 
Design Orchard, 03-01, 50 Orchard Road, 
Open: Monday to Sunday (10am to 7pm)
Why visit? Hailing from Gangnam, Korea, Nowafter Cafe is a little monochrome-themed spot on the roof of Design Orchard, right in the heart of Singapore’s shopping district. It’s a cute cafe in Singapore, where everything is black and white, including its food! 
With a small menu on display, patrons are known to come here to escape the heat, especially after a long day of shopping, or even settle down with a book while enjoying a cup of coffee or a sweet treat. 
Crowd favourites: On particularly warm days, the sourdough waffle gelato (S$15) is a bestseller. It features a charcoal infused sourdough waffle topped with a gelato of your choice, the more popular being the matcha gelato. 
As a thirst quencher, the uji matcha einspanner (S$9.50) comes highly recommended. Matcha connoisseurs would know that uji matcha is the best grade of matcha, giving you a smooth and earthy palate without that astringency you get from lower grade variants.
Here’s our in-depth take on Nowafter cafe. 
195 Pearl’s Hill Terrace, 01-61
 Open: Monday, Thursday and Friday (9am to 6pm), Saturday and Sunday (8am to 6pm)
Why visit? Nestled in a former police barracks, Paaru is a little Japan-inspired hidden gem that makes for a quaint little escape from the chaos of the city. 
With an open kitchen concept, on-theme decor, and a lovely minimalist menu, it’s where you go with your BFF in tow to fix that casual Japanese craving. 
Crowd favourites: A Japanese cafe is only as good as its shokupan (milk bread) so the classic eggs on shokupan (S$13) is the best way to taste it — light, scrambled eggs are dredged over generously thick slices of fluffy bread that makes for a satisfying breakfast. 
The white coffee (S$6) comes highly recommended and best paired with one of its bread items to complete your morning. 
We visited Paaru and this is what we thought.

Why visit? If a cupcake a day kept stressors away, Plain Vanilla would easily be the most famous cafe in Singapore. Founded in 2011 as a humble store making good old-fashioned cupcakes, it now has six stores across the country. More than just serving up artisanal cupcakes, it has expanded to include a lovely brunch menu. 
The red velvet has consistently been a bestseller but if you love chocolate, the dark chocolate ganache is topped with 70% bittersweet dark chocolate ganache and Valrhona cocoa nibs; both taste and texture!
Crowd favourites: With a handful of flavours to choose from, the red velvet, dark chocolate ganache and vanilla bean are highly recommended. It’s hard to stop at just one, so treat yourself and pick up a box of six cupcakes (S$27).

The menu has slight variations from one outlet to the other, along with exclusive dishes for each outlet. Nevertheless, you’ll find cafe staples such as salads, sandwiches and bites to pizzas, pastas and hearty mains. 
Crowd favourites: A cafe isn’t complete with some sort of an egg-focused brunch item and the PS big breakfast (S$29) does not disappoint. It comes with two eggs (of your choice), smoked bacon, spinach, toast, baked beans, a sausage, veggies and our personal favourite, a honey truffle dressing. 
For peckish crowds, the crispy Typhoon calamari (S$22) is made with a delicious batter coating infused with pepper, garlic and fermented black bean paired with a lemon chilli dip. It’s great for sharing and likely to keep you wanting more.

Pair good coffee with an interior that’s inspired by a modern Kyoto teahouse and you know you’re in for a good morning. 
Crowd favourites: As coffee enthusiasts, we love the coffee flight (S$9) option, it serves the single origin coffee of the day in black and white. If you’ve got a liking for matcha, the dirty matcha (S$9) is a must-try. It’s made with Hokkaido fresh milk, giving you a rich mouth-feel and deeper milky flavour.

The kaya Cloud (S$8) is a pandan and jasmine green tea that’s infused in a cold brew and mixed with evaporated milk, kaya cloud and a kaya butter sprinkle. Hard to imagine, but lovely to experience.
